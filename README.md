Welcome to WeatherStream! This project showcases an automated, serverless system for capturing live weather data, processing it efficiently, and loading it into a Snowflake data warehouse for real-time analytics. It's designed to be reliable, scalable, and cost-effective.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architectural Overview: The Big Picture

WeatherStream's architecture is crafted for an efficient, end-to-end journey of real-time weather data. It begins with data extraction from a public API, followed by processing using serverless AWS services, and culminates in loading into Snowflake for powerful analytics. The diagram below visually outlines this entire process:

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Data Journey, Step-by-Step

WeatherStream operates through a clear, automated sequence:

1.  **üì° Step 1: Fetching Live Weather Data**
    *   A Python script ([Fetch_WeatherAPI.py](Fetch_WeatherAPI.py)) automatically retrieves the latest weather information from a public API.
    *   This process is scheduled and triggered by **AWS EventBridge**, ensuring consistent data collection.
        *   *EventBridge Schedule:*
            ![AWS EventBridge Configuration](AWS_EventBridge.png)
    *   The raw data is immediately stored in **AWS DynamoDB**, a fast and flexible NoSQL database.

2.  **üîÑ Step 2: Processing and Preparing Data**
    *   Whenever new data arrives in DynamoDB, it triggers an **AWS Lambda function** (implemented by [DDB2Snowflake.py](DDB2Snowflake.py)) via DynamoDB Streams.
        *   *Lambda Function Setup:*
            ![Lambda Function Configuration](DDB2SF_Lambda_Function.png)
        *   *Lambda Trigger (from DynamoDB):*
            ![Lambda Trigger Setup for DynamoDB Streams](DDB2SF_Lambda_Function_Trigger.png)
    *   This Lambda function processes the data (e.g., cleans, formats) and then exports it to **Amazon S3**, an object storage service, preparing it for the data warehouse.

3.  **‚ùÑÔ∏è Step 3: Loading into Snowflake for Analysis**
    *   **Snowpipe**, Snowflake's continuous data ingestion service, automatically detects new data files in the S3 bucket.
    *   It efficiently loads this processed data into our **Snowflake Data Warehouse**.
    *   Inside Snowflake, SQL scripts ([Snowflake.sql](Snowflake.sql)) transform and model the data, making it ready for analysis and reporting.
